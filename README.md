PLEASE NOTE that the TESTS and CSS files provided are NOT wrote by me. I own mainly JS skills and EVERY js file is hand written by me.
The HTML templates are provided aswell for the :

01. Furniture

   but they are constructed and mapped to the view by me. I was only provided with the skeleton. Eventho i can write HTML myself and have basic CSS skills aswell on selectors and some style to mod them dinamicly useing JS. 

You will have to install the dependancies for the project to run the tests and type some commands:
@select the folder for your terminal where is the root of the app

1 - npm start //to start the test server (is dummy server only the test uses u can't interact in lifeserver with it);

2 - npm test //to run the test please note the server have to run and exec this 2nd line in another terminal!;
